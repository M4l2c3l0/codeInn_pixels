              What text editor should I chose?<br>
              Which is the best one?<br>
              Well, as I understand it, each was designed to fullfil specific tasks, therefore do not bother searching for the <q>best one</q>, but rather the <q>most suitable</q> for your needs, which in our case is web design. So to give you some food for thought, I will start by going through some of the free options I have personally tried, and finish by a short list of a few excellent other choices that I am yet to try.

                  TextWrangler is an all-purpose text and code editor for Mac OS X, based on the same award-winning technology as BBEdit, our leading professional HTML and text editor.

              When starting to learn code, the temptation of picking an editor that does a lot of work for you is high, and after all why wouldn't you?<br>
              One of the best tips I was given and could share with you, is to be alright at walking before trying to run. If like me you would like to make sure you are able to code all on your own before trying out another editor that will reduce and chew a lot of your work for you, then all you need for now is a simple and clear editor such as TextWrangler with just the basic features that really matter.

                  With focused visual tools and preprocessor support, Brackets is a modern text editor that makes it easy to design in the browser. It's crafted from the ground up for web designers and front-end developers.
                </q>

              (source: brackets.io)<br><br>
              Seriously pumped-up with great features such as <q>live preview</q>, which displays in real-time any HTML or CSS changes (requires Google Chrome), or <q>inline editors</q> allowing you to style elements from the HTML document without switching files, it is to my knowledge one of the most web design oriented text editors.<br>
              So although I did not rant nor rate any of the text editors in this article, Brackets has to be one of my highest recommendations for front-end developers, and one I have been using ever since discovering it.

                  Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the core â€” a tool you can customise to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.

              </i><br>
              (source: atom.io)<br><br>
              Developed by GitHub, which for those of you (like me) who are not too familiar with, seems to be home to a HUGE open-source community, Atom consequently has an astonishing amount of themes and extension packages allowing you to personalise the editor to your every need. What's more, if you are still unable to find an extension or theme you'd like, Atom basically allows you to code it yourself!<br>
              With such potential and flexibility, and although it is not necessarely a web-development oriented editor to start with, Atom really seems to appeal to all kind of coders, and since briefly trying it out, one I look forward to get more familiar with.

                  Its price tag of $70 USD (free trial available) clearly seems to be justified by its highly acclaimed performance, customizable interface, and incredible community support. Hands down one of the most popular worldwide.<br>
